# HealthSync User Guide

---

HealthSync is a **desktop application tailored for healthcare administrators in family clinics.** It centralises patients' personal information and emergency contact details into a single, easily accessible database, enabling administrators to efficiently manage data and contacts.

By combining the speed of a Command Line Interface (CLI) with the visual clarity of a Graphical User Interface (GUI), HealthSync optimizes workflow for fast-typing administrators, enabling them to retrieve critical patient details and establish contact more efficiently than traditional GUI-only applications.

This ensures rapid response in a sector where every second matters.

---

> **⚠️ Warning:** HealthSync is only designed for **Singapore-based family clinics**. It operates exclusively in **English** and does not support other languages or international clinic formats.

Using HealthSync with other languages or across multiple countries and timezones may lead to unexpected behaviour.

[Return Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Example:
* `undo` (Restores the state before the last action)

### Redoing a command: `redo`

Restores the last undone command.

Format: `redo`

> **⚠️ Warning:**
> * Can only be used if `undo` was previously executed.
> * Cannot redo commands that were not undone.
> * Cannot be used repeatedly to redo multiple actions.

Example:
* `redo` (Restores the last undone action)

### Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program.

Format: `exit`

### Saving the data

HealthSync data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

HealthSync data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

> **⚠️ Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, HealthSync will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the HealthSync to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous HealthSync home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimise the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimised, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Valid Inputs for Patient parameters

A patient is uniquely identified by their `NAME` and `PHONE_NUMBER` or `NAME` and `EMAIL`. Patients with the same `NAME` and `PHONE_NUMBER` or `NAME` and `EMAIL` will be flagged as duplicates and cannot be added to the address book.

This also applies to emergency contacts. To prevent unexpected app behavior, do not edit an emergency contact to have the same phone number as another emergency contact for the same patient. If an emergency contact is edited to have the same name and phone number as an existing one, it will be considered a duplicate and will trigger an error.
